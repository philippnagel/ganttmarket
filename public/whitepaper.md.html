Abstract
===============================================================================

This paper examines the application of Web3 decentralized prediction markets in managing mega projects. By utilizing blockchain technology, these markets offer shared liquidity and customizable market creation, enhancing decision-making, risk management, and stakeholder engagement. The paper explores the architecture, benefits, challenges, and practical applications of integrating decentralized prediction markets into project management strategies.

Introduction
